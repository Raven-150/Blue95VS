Blue95 is a modern and lightweight desktop experience that is reminiscent of a bygone era of computing.
Based on Fedora Atomic Xfce with the [Chicago95](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95) theme. My adjustments to this are to make it more personalized to myself and adding more functionalityt for gaming and programming.
