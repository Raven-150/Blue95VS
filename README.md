Blue95 is a modern and lightweight desktop experience that is reminiscent of a bygone era of computing.
Based on Fedora Atomic Xfce with the [Chicago95](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95) theme. My adjustments are to make it more personalized to myself and adding more functionalityt for gaming and programming.

## Try It Out

> [!NOTE]  
> Live CD is a new feature and is still in testing.

We are now creating a [Live ISO](https://pub-969fbc86b5f24e4d81c6d022e8fd8dde.r2.dev/blue95-live-latest.iso) that can be used to boot into a Blue95 live environment. Test it out without needing to install anything.

Note that the included installer is an alpha version with many missing features. It is recommended to install Blue95 via the methods listed in the [Install Guide](https://blues.win/95/docs/install).
